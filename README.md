# Azure Cloud Implemention

## Problem Domain
    Cutter & Buck's' field sales staff submits daily, weekly reports, and communication via email. 
    This administrative task takes an hour of their daily schedule.
    Likewise, the sales manager has to receive all of the email and manual collate into a single report.

## Project Proposal
Implement a Azure cloud platform for the field sales team  - streamlining the reporting process.
Automate the process to organize the files reported by sales team for Sales Manager to review.
Monitor any security threat and malware/ransomware on the machine and able to prevent it on sight.
Salesforce can easily have IT help due to virtualization.
Provide routine backup and disk cleanup to increase the accessibility and performance.
